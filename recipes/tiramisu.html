       <p class="Desc">These are the ingredients and steps to make a fluffy Tiramisu every single time!</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</p>
            <p>8 ounce container mascarpone cheese at room temperature</p>
            <p>1/3 cup granulated sugar</p>
            <p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
            <p>1 1/2 cups cold espresso</p>
            <p>3 Tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur</p>
            <p>1 package Lady Fingers</p>
            <p>Cocoa powder</p>

       <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">1.</span> Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">2.</span> Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">3.</span> Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">4.</span> Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.</p>
