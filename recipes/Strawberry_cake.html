        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>2 cups white sugar</p>
            <p>1 cup butter, softened</p>
            <p>1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-O®</p>
            <p>4 large eggs (room temperature)</p>
            <p>2 ¾ cups sifted cake flour</p>
            <p>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</p>
            <p>1 cup whole milk, room temperature</p>
            <p>½ cup strawberry puree made from frozen sweetened strawberries</p>
            <p>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</p>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">2.</span> Beat sugar, butter, and dry strawberry gelatin together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">3.</span> Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl; stir into butter mixture alternately with milk.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">4.</span> Blend in strawberry puree and vanilla.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">5.</span> Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">6.</span> Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes; run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack to cool completely.</p>
